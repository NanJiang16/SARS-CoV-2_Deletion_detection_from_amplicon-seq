# Deletion detection in SARS-CoV-2 genomes using multiplex-PCR sequencing from COVID-19 patients: elimination of false positives

## Scripts

* `interleave_paired_end_fastq.py` - Interleaves paired-end FASTQ files, appending _1 and _2 to the read names.  To be used for creating input files for Virema.
* `filter_aligned_reads.py` - Filters aligned reads that are likely to have resulted from primer dimers or similar artifacts.
* `extract_deletions.py` - Creates a table of deletions from an alignment file, with information about the primers that flank the deletion.
* `standardize_alignments.py` - Standardizes the deletion positions within alignments.
* `annotate_alignment_with_primers.py` - Annotates an alignment file with information about the closest upstream/downstream primer to each read as well as the fraction of the read's alignment that is to primer regions.
* `extract_primer_info.py` - Extracts primer information from a primer-annotated alignment file.
* `deletion_summarization_and_further_filtration.R` - Summarizes read deletions (output from `extract_deletions.py`), calculates their frequencies using coverage information, and exclude deletion junctions with: Frequency < 0.01, Depth < 5, MinCov (smaller depth at the deletion start and stop positions) < 21, Maximum overhang on either end ('max_right_overhang' or 'max_left_overhang') < 31, Depth of positive or negative strands < 3.
###BASH Pipeline Scripts
This repository includes three executable BASH scripts that automate the full environment setup and analysis workflows:
* `setup_env.sh` - Creates and configures the Conda environment required for both STAR- and ViReMa-based pipelines. This script installs all necessary tools, dependencies, and Python packages to ensure a fully reproducible analysis environment.
* `run_virema_pipeline.sh` - Implements the complete ViReMa analysis workflow, including adapter trimming, read interleaving, ViReMa alignment, alignment standardization, filtering, deletion extraction, and optional downstream summarization using the R script. This pipeline is designed for recombination/deletion detection using ViReMa (v0.25).
* `run_star_pipeline.sh` - Runs the STAR-based pipeline following the parameters of Wong et al., including trimming, STAR alignment, deletion standardization, primer-aware filtering, deletion extraction, coverage computation, and optional R-based summarization.
* Each script contains user-configurable variables at the top, allowing users to easily specify sample names, file paths, and parameter settings for their own datasets.

## Python modules

The above scripts rely on the following Python module files:

* `fastq.py` - Classes for reading and writing FASTQ files.
* `dvg.py` - Utility functions for extracting deletions from alignments and comparing with primer information.

## Usage examples 
The pipeline starts in Conda enviroment. The following command lines examplify the workflow.
To set up the same software environment on your own system:
```bash
# 1. Install Miniconda or Anaconda if not already installed
#    https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

# 2. Create a new environment named "python3" with Python 3.10
conda create -y -n SARS-CoV-2_Deletion_detection_from_amplicon-seq python=3.10

# 3. Activate the environment
conda activate SARS-CoV-2_Deletion_detection_from_amplicon-seq

# 4. Configure channels
conda config --add channels r
conda config --add channels bioconda
conda config --add channels conda-forge

# 5. Install tools and libraries
conda install -y -c conda-forge mamba
mamba install -y star=2.7.3a samtools=1.10
conda install -y -c bioconda bedtools
conda install -y pysam pandas numpy
conda install -y -c conda-forge openjdk perl perl-json

# 6. Verify installation
python --version
star --version
samtools --version | head -1
bedtools --version
```
